<p>Welcome to my Visual Web Portfolio! Here, you will find a collection of personally crafted web pages to showcase my abilities in web design. Each folder provides sneakpeaks of layouts I have created, but have not found a use for in a project.</p>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>If your just seeking inspiration for a future web page build, be my guest! If you are interested in the technical design of the page, collaborating on a project, or taking a design from the portfolio to use for a website, please contact me first. My prefered contact information can be found in the badges at the top of this file.</p>
